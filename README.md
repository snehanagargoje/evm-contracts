# EVM Practice Contracts

This repository contains my personal practice smart contracts to learn Solidity and EVM development. 
All contracts have been tested locally using Hardhat/Remix.

Files:
- SimpleStorage.sol – basic storage contract
- ERC20Token.sol – practice ERC-20 token
- NFTContract.sol – practice ERC-721 NFT
